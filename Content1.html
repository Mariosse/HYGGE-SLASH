<!-- ARTICLE -->
    <p>Interior designer and blogger Ditte Gimm Larsen oozes modern Danish design. The 31-year-old, who lives in Hørning with her husband 
    and two children, has been giving us sneak peeks into her lifestyle through her blog ‘ditteblog.dk’ since 2013.  
    Since much of Ditte’s content is on her fabulous interior design style, HYGGE/SLASH caught up with her to talk all things style, 
    brands, and DIY projects.</p>
    
    <p>Scrolling through photos of Ditte’s beautiful home, its easy to fall in love with the laidback-but-put-together
    style. Her house seems modern, yet somehow timeless.</p>

    <br>

<!-- FOCUS LINE -->
    <h2>“I try to create content that has a long life. For example, guides that can be searched for again and again, 
        even if it has been on the blog for a couple of years”.</h2>

    <br>

<!-- ARTICLE -->
    <p>However, Ditte reveals that one of her huge influences is in fact Instagram. “On Instagram I follow many people who have a focus on interior 
    design. But also Pinterest if I am looking for inspiration for something specific.” These style influences are clearly shown throughout Ditte’s
    home, which mixes high end furniture with items from mainstream stores.</p>
   
    <p>The key, according to Ditte, is to invest in one-off timeless pieces. “I love classic designer furniture that we can invest in and have for the rest of our lives. For example Wegner and Børge Mogensen. 
    My favourite piece of furniture is a chair designed by Jørgen Bækmark. I also love Hübsch, who makes a lot of classic oak furniture.”</p>

    <p>OK, so what about those whose budget doesn’t quite stretch to Danish design classics? Turns out Ditte can help with that too. 
    She also includes DIY projects in her blog, often with step-by-step instructions. Ditte also has some advice for those who are new 
    to DIY: “Find some good guides online so it's a success to get you started. Start with some small projects. For example, painting a 
    piece of furniture or a wall. For larger projects to be built, it may be a good idea to team up with someone who is used to these 
    sorts of projects. I always ask my father for advice!”</p>
    
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? Why not grab a friend and get your DIY on? 
    And remember to post your results on HYGGE/SLASH to inspire others.</p>
